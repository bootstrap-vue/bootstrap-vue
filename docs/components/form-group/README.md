# Form group

> The `<b-form-group>` component is the easiest way to add some structure to forms. Its
purpose is to provide a label and control pairing, help text and feedback text, as well
as contextual state visual feedback.

```html
<template>
  <b-form-group
      id="fieldset1"
      description="Let us know your name."
      label="Enter your name"
      :feedback="feedback" 
      :state="state"
  >
    <b-form-input id="input1" :state="state" v-model.trim="name"></b-form-input>
  </b-form-group>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    feedback() {
      return this.name.length > 0 ? '' : 'Please enter something';
    },
    state() {
      return this.name.length > 0 ? 'valid' : 'invalid';
    }
  },
  data: {
    name: '',
  }
}
</script>

<!-- form-group-1.vue -->
```

## Label
Use the prop `label` to set the content of the generated `<label>` element (html supported),
or by using the named slot `label`, You may optionally visually hide the label by setting
the prop `label-sr-only`.

By default, the label appears above the input element, but you may optionally set
the prop `horizontal` to place the label on the same line, and control the width
of the label by setting `label-cols` to the number of columns (default of `3`,
valid range of 1 through 11). `label-cols` has no effect if the layout is
not `horizontal`. For viewports below size `sm`, the label will revert to
being displayed above the input control. You can control the breakpoint for this
by setting the `breakpoint` prop (default is `sm`).

The label text may also optionally be aligned `left`, `center` or `right` by setting
the respective value via the prop `label-text-align`. Alignment has no effect if
`label-sr-only` is set.

## Description
Optional descriptive text which is always shown with the `.text-muted` class
(html supported) by setting the `description` prop or using the named slot `description`.
The description text is rendered using the <`b-form-text>` component.

## Feedback
Show optional feedback text to provide textual state feedback (html supported)
by setting the prop `feedback` or using the named slot `feedback`.

Note that the feedback **will not be shown** unless the `invalid` state is set on the
`<b-form-group>` and it's child(ren) input(s) or just on the input (`b-form-input>`, `b-form-textarea>`, `<b-form-select>`,
`<b-form-checkbox>`, `<b-form-radio>`, or `<b-form-file>`).

Also feedback will be shown if the parent `<b-form>` component does not have the
`novalidate` prop set (or set to `false`) along with `vadidated`
prop set (and the input fails browser native validation constraintes such as `required`).

Refer to Bootstrap V4's `Form` component documentation for details on validation methods.

Feedback is rendered using the `<b-form-feedback>` componment.

## Contextual visual state
Bootstrap includes validation styles for `valid` and `invalid` states
on most form controls.

Generally speaking, you’ll want to use a particular state for specific types of feedback:
- `'invalid'` is great for when there’s a blocking or required field. A user must fill in
this field properly to submit the form.
- `'valid'` is ideal for situations when you have per-field validation throughout a form
and want to encourage a user through the rest of the fields.
- `null` Displayes no validation state

To apply one of the contextual state icons on `<b-form-group>`, set the `state` prop
to `'invalid'`, `'valid'`, or `null`.

You should always provide content via the `feedback` prop (or slot) to aid users
using assistive technologies when setting a contextual `invalid` state.

### Accessibility
To enable auto-generation of `aria-*` attributes, **you must** supply a unique `id`
prop to `<b-form-fieldset>`.

To automatically associate the label to the first input component, you **must** provide
a unique `id` prop on the input component. You may manually specify which containing
input component the label is for by setting the `<b-form-group>` prop `label-for`
to the value of the `id` string associated with the input or contaner element.

It is **highly recommended** that you provide a unique `id` prop on your input element.

### Alias
`<b-form-group>` can also be used via the legacy alias of `<b-form-fieldset>`.
