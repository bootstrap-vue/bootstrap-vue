# Pagination

> Quick previous and next links for simple pagination implementations with light markup and styles.
  Itâ€™s great for simple sites like blogs or magazines.
  Provide pagination links for your site or app with the multi-page pagination component.

`b-pagination` is a custom input component that provides a current page number (starting from 1) input.
The value should be bound via `v-model` in your app.

### Customizing
Pagination supports selveral props that allow you to customize the apperance.

| Prop | Description
| ---- | -----------
| `limit` | Limit the maximum numbr of buttons (including ellipsis, but not prev/next)
| `firstText` | The "goto first page" button text (html supported)
| `prevText` | The "goto previous page" button text (html supported)
| `nextText` | The "goto next page" button text (html supported)
| `lastText` | The "goto last page" button text (html supported)
| `ellipsisText` | the `...` spacer text (html supported)

### Small screen support (`xs`)
One smaller screens, some of the page buttons will be hidden to ensure pagination
fits on a single line.

- The ellipsis indicators will be hidden on screens `xs` and smaller.
- Page number buttons will be limitted to a maximum of 3 visible on `xs` screens and smaller.

This ensures that no more than 3 page number buttons are visible,
along with the goto _first_, _prev_, _next_, and _last_ buttons.


### events
- `input` is emitted anytime the page number changes (either programmatically or via user interction)
- `change` is emitted only when the page number changes based on user interaction

Both events provide the single argument of the current page number (starting from 1)
