# Pagination

> Quick previous and next links for simple pagination implementations with light markup and styles.
  Itâ€™s great for simple sites like blogs or magazines.
  Provide pagination links for your site or app with the multi-page pagination component.

`b-pagination` is a custom input component that provides a current page number input control.
The value should be bound via `v-model` in your app. Page numbers are indexed from 1. The number
of pages is computed from the provided prop values for `total-rows` and `per-page`.

### Customizing
Pagination supports selveral props that allow you to customize the apperance.

| Prop | Description
| ---- | -----------
| `limit` | Limit the maximum numbr of page buttons (including ellipsis if present, but not the first/prev/next/last buttons)
| `total-rows` | The total number of records in your data
| `per-page` | The maximum number of data records per page
| `first-text` | The "goto first page" button text (html supported)
| `prev-text` | The "goto previous page" button text (html supported)
| `next-text` | The "goto next page" button text (html supported)
| `last-text` | The "goto last page" button text (html supported)
| `ellipsis-text` | the `...` indicator text (html supported)
| `hide-ellipsis` | never show ellipsis indicators
| `hide-goto-end-buttons` | never display goto first/last buttons

Ellipsis inidcator(s) will only be ever shown at the front and/or end of
the page number buttons. For `limit` values less than or equal to `4`, the ellipsis indicator(s) will never
be shown for practial display reasons.


### Small screen support (`xs`)
On smaller screens (i.e. mobile), some of the pagination buttons will be hidden to
minimize the potntial of the pagination interface wraping onto multiple lines:

- The ellipsis indicators will be hidden on screens `xs` and smaller.
- Page number buttons will be limitted to a maximum of 3 visible on `xs` screens and smaller.

This ensures that no more than 3 page number buttons are visible,
along with the goto _first_, _prev_, _next_, and _last_ buttons.

### Accessibility
`b-pagination` provides various `xxx-label` attributes which are used for `aria-label`
attributes on the various elements within the component, to help
assistive technology users

Keyboard navigtion is also supported out of the box:
- Tabbing into the pagination component will autofocus the current page button
- Left and right arrow keys will focus the previous and next buttons in the page
list, and `ENTER` and `SAPCE` keys will select (click) the focused page button

### Events
`b-pagination` provides two events that are emitted on the component:
- `input` is emitted anytime the page number changes (either programmatically or via user interaction)
- `change` is emitted only when the page number changes based on user interaction

Both events provide the single argument of the current page number (starting from 1)
