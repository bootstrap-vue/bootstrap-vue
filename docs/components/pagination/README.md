# Pagination

> Quick previous and next links for simple pagination implementations with light markup and styles.
  Itâ€™s great for simple sites like blogs or magazines.
  Provide pagination links for your site or app with the multi-page pagination component.

`b-pagination` is a custom input component that provides a current page number (starting from 1) input.
The value should be bound via `v-model` in your app.

### events
- `input` is emitted anytime the page number changes (either programmatically or via user interction)
- `change` is emitted only when the page number changes based on user interaction

Both events provide the single argument of the current page number (starting from 1)
