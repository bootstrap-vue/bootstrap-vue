# List group

> List groups are a flexible and powerful component for displaying a series of content.
  List group items can be modified and extended to support just about any content within.
  They can also be used as navigation with the right modifier class.

```html
<b-list-group>
  <b-list-group-item active>
    Awesome list
  </b-list-group-item>
  <b-list-group-item to="#">
    Action links are easy
  </b-list-group-item>
  <b-list-group-item>
    This is a text only item
  </b-list-group-item>
</b-list-group>

<!-- list-group.vue -->
```
