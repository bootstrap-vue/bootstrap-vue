# Button group

> Group a series of buttons together on a single line with `b-button group`.

### Sizing
Set the size prop to `lg` or `sm` to render larger or smaller, respectively, buttons.
There is no need to specify the size on the individual buttons.

### Vertical variation
Make a set of buttons appear vertically stacked rather than horizontally by setting
the `vertical` prop. Split button dropdowns are not supported here.

### Justification
Make horizontal `b-button-group` span the entire width of its prent container by
setting the `justify` prop. This setting has no effect when `vertical` is set.

### Alias
`b-button` group can also be used by its shorter alias `b-btn-group`.

toolbars containing button groups and input groups.
