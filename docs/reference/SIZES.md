# Sizes

> Various components allow for an optional size (via hte `size` prop). Below are the
sizez supported via the default Bootsrap V4 CSS.

Available Sizes:

* `sm` small
* `lg` large

When no size is specified, this results in normal sized appearance (usually
referend to as `md`).

These size values will be translated into the apropriate Bootstrap CSS class,
depending on the component used on, such as `btn-<size>` for buttons, `modal-<size>`
for modal, `form-control-<size>` for form elements, `pagination-<size>` for
pagination, etc.
