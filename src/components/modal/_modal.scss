// Needed to allow Vue transition system to work with Bootstrap v4 .modal-backdrop
// as modal opacity is 1 by default
.modal-backdrop {
  opacity: $modal-backdrop-opacity;
}

// When draggable property is set to true
// cursor is all-scroll on modal-header hover
.modal-drag {
  cursor: all-scroll;
}
